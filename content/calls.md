#### Scope

Analysis of algorithms is a scientific basis for computation,
providing a link between abstract algorithms and the performance characteristics of their implementations in the real
world. The general effort to precisely predict the performance
of algorithms has come to involve research in analytic combinatorics, the analysis of random discrete structures, asymptotic analysis, exact and limiting distributions, and other fields of inquiry in computer science, probability theory, and enumerative
combinatorics. See [www.math.aau.at/AofA/](https://www.math.aau.at/AofA/).

We invite papers in
* analytic algorithmics and combinatorics,
* probabilistic analysis of algorithms and
* randomized algorithms.

We also welcome papers addressing problems such as: combinatorial algorithms, string searching and pattern matching,
sublinear algorithms on massive data sets, network algorithms,
graph algorithms, caching and memory hierarchies, indexing,
data mining, data compression, coding and information theory, and computational finance. Papers are also welcome that
address bridges to research in related fields such as statistical physics, computational biology, computational geometry, and simulation.

#### Submissions

We invite you to submit an extended abstract of up to 12 pages, excluding references. Appendices can be included in addition to that. They will be read at the Program Committee's
discretion, but will not be included in the conference proceedings.
