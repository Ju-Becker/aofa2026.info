#### Important Dates

* Deadline: March 1, 2026
* Acceptance notice: April 20, 2026
* Camera ready: May 4, 2026
* Conference: June 22-26, 2026

#### Submissions

We invite you to submit an extended abstract of up to 12-15 pages, excluding the
the front page, bibliography, and a brief appendix of up to 5 pages.
Further appendices can be included in addition to that, and they will be read at the [Program Committee's](https://aofa2026.info/committees/) discretion, but will not be included in the proceedings.

Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. PC members are allowed to submit their works as well, except for PC chairs.

For the submission and the final version of the papers you are required to use the
Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs). For the LaTex templates and
further information please consult the [LIPIcs](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) page.

#### Scope

Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.
See also [here](https://www.math.aau.at/AofA/) for more information on the community and prior events.
We invite papers in
* analytic algorithmics and combinatorics,
* probabilistic analysis of algorithms and
* randomized algorithms.

We also welcome papers addressing problems such as: combinatorial algorithms, string searching and pattern matching,
sublinear algorithms on massive data sets, network algorithms,
graph algorithms, caching and memory hierarchies, indexing,
data mining, data compression, coding and information theory, and computational finance. Papers are also welcome that
address bridges to research in related fields such as statistical physics, computational biology, computational geometry, and simulation.

#### Conference

At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference.
